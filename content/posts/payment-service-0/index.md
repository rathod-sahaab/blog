## Foreword
This is a story of technical debt, and its inevitable pay off. It's not a cautionary tale and let's not takeaway that technical debt is bad, technical debt is much like financial debt and most of our modern economy is built on debt. Debt is not bad only if you can pay it off, tell that to the governments around the world.

## Let's start from the middle
In my day job at [Tealfeed](https://tealfeed.com) we added a revenue generating feature, with **stripe** as the payment gateway. Everything worked well, and we lived happily ever after. Right? Wrong! First we added few more features and then few more payment gateways all in good faith and name of business needs, and then, the code was, to put it lightly, BLOATED. Mathematically speaking the code scaled with order of `A Ã— B` *(cross product)* `A` being the number of features and `B` being the number of payment gateways.

A few hair pulling problems arose due to this, concoction of features and payment gateways.
1. Bugs fixed once in payment logic still occurred somewhere overlooked.
2. Payment logic polluted the business logic allowing for blunder-full programming experience.
3. Code for resolution on which payment to use had to be done in multiple places. So business agility went out the window.
4. Each of our feature's database models contained information regarding payment voiding the much beloved SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) from SOLID.
    1. Not all features had all the payment info as adding the payment info code was a manual task prone to human error.
    2. Made the db models bloated, and fetch code where payment status had to be checked either in query or in code.
    3. Our analytics capabilities were limited due to payment related data being distributed.
5. Ghost purchases: as the payment info was stored in feature models we had to create a ghost purchases just to store payments data which were marked successful in some way if the payment was successful. If payment was not successful the payment was not successful the purchases still lingered. All our queries had to account for that.

```typescript
class Call {
  ...callData,
  status: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure';
  amount: number, // TODO: string 
  currency: ICurrencyCode,
  clientIp: string,
  country: string | null,
  paymentGateway: 'stripe' | 'phonepe';
  paymentGatewayTransactionId: string;
}

class Package {
  ...packageData,
  status: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure';
  amount: number, // TODO: string 
  currency: ICurrencyCode,
  paymentGateway: 'stripe' | 'phonepe';
  paymentGatewayTransactionId: string;
}

class Webinar {
  ...webinarData,
  status: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure';
  amount: number, // TODO: string 
  currency: ICurrencyCode,
  paymentGateway: 'stripe' | 'phonepe';
  paymentGatewayTransactionId: string;
}
```

And we don't want that.

## What do we want?
Our payments service/module should
1. Centralize all of the payment gateway selection logic.
2. Be open to addition of new payment gateways with minimal effort.
3. Not depend on the features and be agnostic of them in a functional sense.
4. Not depend on payment gateway specific features *(vendor workaround code is not fun)*.
5. Centralize all the payments related data
6. No ghost purchases.

# Design
Any good back-end feature design starts with the data, so let's build up our data model. There are two major parts to our payments data, Orders and Transactions.
1. Order: is like a shopping cart, it remembers what you are trying to buy.
2. Transactions: these store the data about attempts of payments for a particular user.

An Order can have multiple Transactions, in case customer retries failed payments, but, in order(pun intended) to state the obvious only one successful Transaction.

### Order
First things first, we need to know 
1. who is buying.
2. what is being bought.
2. for how much.
3. and from whom.
Whom can be technically optional as product contains data about the seller but it makes analytics a lot easier.
```typescript
class Order {
  // who
  buyer: User;

  // what
  productType: ProductTableName; // 'call_type' | 'package' | 'webinar'
  productId: Id;

  // how much
  amount: number; // TODO: string
  currency: ICurrencyCode; // 'INR' | 'USD',

  // whom
  seller: User;
}
```

And then we need to know weather this purchase was successful, failed, other little good-y statuses, and which was the successful transaction if any.
```typescript
class Order {
  ...prev,
  status: 'created' | 'paid' | 'canceled' | 'refunded' | 'failed';
  successfulTransaction?: TransactionId;
}
```

Weather this order was paid out to the creator.
```typescript
class Order {
  ...prev,
  paidOut: boolean;
}
```

Extra data: some of the products like call also contain specific data like start & end times. Which is not shared in other products this was earlier stored in either ghost purchases or stripe meta-data. But as the requirement were no ghost purchases and PG specific vendor features we need to store that data too. Hence order has a meta-data field to store
```typescript
class Order {
  ...prev,
  data: any;
}
```

### Transaction
